# Breast_cancer_data
Here I'm building my own algorithm to learn more about how it works.  To exemplify classification, I'm going to use a Breast Cancer Dataset, which is a dataset donated to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) collection from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. UCI has a large Machine Learning Repository. The datasets here are organized by types of machine learning often used for them, data types, attribute types, topic areas, and a few others. Very useful both for educational uses, as well as for Machine Learninng algortihm development
The breast cancer database is a publicly available dataset from the UCI Machine learning Repository. It gives information on tumor features such as tumor size, density, and texture.
Goal: To create a classification model that looks at predicts if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several features.
Data used: University of California
